Goal:
Goal in this assignment is to make a Static website of your choice (Your website could be anything: any business, a favorite author or your favorite personality’s portfolio except politicians). 
Your website must contain 5 pages at least: Some example pages are as follows:
•	Main page e.g. index, Must Contain lists, anchors (LinkedIn or GitHub account), Tables, Paragraphs.
•	Map showing any location
•	Gallery (For your photos)
•	About section 
•	A fifth page could be a Site Map (You can use designing tools like MS Visio to generate that for your Website)
•	Any other page or subpages you would like to add
A page in your website must contain an image when media is screen but you should also generate styles for print media. E.g. images should be removed from a page when you send a print command.
Try to test your website on multiple browsers like Firefox, chrome, edge and IE. Your designed layout must not change when browser changes (Layout must remain the same across all browsers)
