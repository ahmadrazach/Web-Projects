      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>Abdul Sattar Edhi was born on 28 July 1928 in Bantva, Gujarat, British India (present-day India) to a Memon family.[1][23][24][25] In his biography, he said his mother would give him 1 paisa for his meals and another to give to a poor/needy child. When Edhi was eleven years old, his mother became paralysed from a stroke and died by the time he turned nineteen in 1947. His personal experiences as a dedicated caretaker for his mother during her illness drove him to develop a system of services for the old, mentally/physically ill and challenged. The partitioning of India later that same year led Edhi and his family to migrate to the newly founded Pakistan.[26][27] He shifted to Karachi to work in a wholesale market. He initially started as a peddler, and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community</p>
      <h2>The Edhi Foundation and Bilquis Edhi Trust</h2>
      <p>During his time in London, Edhi resolved to dedicate his life to aiding the poor, and over the next sixty years, he single-handedly changed the face of welfare in Pakistan.[citation needed] He subsequently founded the Edhi Foundation.[citation needed] Additionally, his previously established welfare trust, named the Edhi Trust was restarted with an initial sum of Rs.5000, the trust was later renamed after his wife as the Bilquis Edhi Trust.[citation needed] Widely regarded and respected as a guardian and saviour for the poor, Edhi began receiving numerous donations which allowed him to expand his services. To this day, the Edhi Foundation continues to grow in both size and service and currently remains the largest welfare organization in Pakistan. Since its inception, the Edhi Foundation has rescued over 20,000 abandoned infants, rehabilitated over 50,000 orphans and has trained over 40,000 nurses.[46] It also runs more than 330 welfare centres throughout rural and urban Pakistan that operate as food kitchens, rehabilitation homes, shelters for abandoned women and children, and clinics for the mentally and physically handicapped.</p>
      <h2>Illness and death</h2>
      <p>25 June 2013, Edhi's was hospitalized due to failing kidneys; it was announced that he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life unless he found a kidney donor.[64] He later died on 8 July 2016 at the age of 88 due to complete kidney failure after having been placed on a ventilator. One of his last wishes was that his organs be donated for the use of the needy but due to his poor health, only his corneas were suitable for later use in donation.[65] He was laid to rest at Edhi Village in Karachi.</p>
