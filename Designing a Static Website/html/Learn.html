    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Learn from Edhi</h1>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">Edhi’s whole life is a case study that we should all learn from and apply in our lives. Here are some life-changing lessons from the man’s extraordinary life that will be helpful for entrepreneurs, leaders of tomorrow, or anyone who just strives to live a better life.</blockquote>
    <h2>1. Never judge others</h2>
    <p>Edhi was one of the least judgmental people. It was one of his most defining traits that allowed him to serve everyone equally regardless of where they came from. If we judge someone based on how they look or what they may have done, we unconsciously wire our brain to see just what we want to see.

      Every encounter we have with that person will be measured against that first judgment. This means that based on your first impression of someone, which is often deceptive, you will probably never get to discover the best part of their personality.
      
      Edhi was often regarded as the most tolerant – which came from his unflinching ability to accept people as they are.</p>
    <h2>2. Humanity above religion</h2>
    <p>He was once asked, “Why must you pick up Christians and Hindus in your ambulance?”, his reply was, “Because the ambulance is more Muslim than you.”

      All religions of this world emphasise on empathy, care, peace, co-existence and love. It is easy to be carried away by certain religious beliefs . But what is difficult – and truly exemplary – is the ability to transcend something so deep and personal like religion, to help another individual no matter the differences.
      
      Edhi was just that – a human being who believed in love and empathy irrespective of religion, cast, creed and gender.
      
      His strong emphasis on humanity above religion helped him grow his organisation beyond the borders.</p>
 
    <H2>3. Accolades don’t matter</H2>
    <p>You cannot be a true humanitarian unless you have closely seen misery, hardship and suffering. Edhi had witnessed all these things and more. He had no interest in worldly prizes and accolades. To him, caring for people came naturally and he was more than happy to do it.</p>
    <h2>4. Head down, focus on your work</h2>
    <p>When running an organisation, it is easy to be carried away with good things that come bundled along the way, especially money and fame, but Edhi wasn’t interested in any of these.</p>
