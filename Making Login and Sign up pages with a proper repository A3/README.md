# Making Login and Sign up pages with a proper repository

The goal of this assignment is to develop login and sign up pages. You could use MySQL database (PDO) or a FILE to store user credentials.

Your pages must include:

· Cookies

· Session

· Validations

Don’t forget to destroy the session in case of logout.

You could also use bootstrap for frontend for this assignment. We haven’t studied that in class yet so anyone not opting for it would not lose any marks but if you are okay with html, css and javascript, it might be a better approach to design the pages with mobile first approach now.
